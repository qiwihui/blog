Hi, my name is *Chris Qiu*, and this is my blog about programming, thinking and other things I would like to share.

I am a web developer and I write Python for most of my time. I am also interested in Go, iOS and Rust.

I have a cat per named Doggy. Yeah, he behaves just like a dog. He likes catching balls and running.
